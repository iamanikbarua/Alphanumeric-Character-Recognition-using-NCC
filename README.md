# Alphanumeric-Character-Recognition-using-NCC
I present a simple model of an Alphanumeric character recognition system using a Template Matching algorithm based on Normalized Cross Correlation. The software is implemented using MATLAB. The input images must be in .png/jpeg format. This system can recognize Alphanumeric characters with an average accuracy of 96.99%.
